          <h2>a new collaboration model</h2>
          <p>
          Peer-to-peer networking offers a new design space for bazaar-style development, as it provides new communication pathways for developers that aren't limited by current processes and workflows. That's why we've decided to pursue a **multi-upstream** model for Radicle. We've realized by exploring multi-upstream peer-to-peer development makes it far easier for developers and maintainers to develop not just a shared, but a **trusted** representation grounded in actual source code *and* secure peer identities.

          <p>
          Our mission is to create a peer-to-peer network run by the free software community and backed by a sustainable economy ‚Äî one in which value is redistributed back to those who contribute and maintain our digital commons. Therefore, we plan to distribute a majority of the network to the greater free and open source community.
