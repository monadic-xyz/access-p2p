The community suffers from similar diversity concerns that the general tech industry faces 2. There are few introductory materials to support those who are curious about P2P and want to figure out how to transition into the space. Therefore, we created AccessP2P to build this library of introductory materials and host a small cohort to take advantage of a supportive peer group and a network of Berlin-based mentors and experts. While we believe that this is a good starting point for increasing the diversity of those entering the P2P space, we are aware that we might not get everything right.

Outside of the lecture time itself, lecturers *might* give an article or two as preparatory reading - but these will be limited and not required (though to your benefit).
